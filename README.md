# Popularity of my daughter's name

This project has been completed before my daughter was born in 2016. The goal of the project was to use Pandas to retrieve data and do explonatary analysis. Finally, use matplotlib library and create a simple chart to visualaze data.

### Dataset
I found the US baby names dataset from the [Social Security Administration.][4] This file can be downloaded from the SSA, and you get the US names for each year. However, I chose to download the dataset from [kaggleâ€™s website][5] because this dataset has only four columns (name, year, gender and count) which I found to fit my research needs and be easier to work with. The names are from 1880 to 2014 and there are 1,825,433 rows in the file.

### Initial notebook
nbviewer version of the notebook is [here.][1]

### Resources
